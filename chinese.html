    Indian Chinese cuisine, Indo-Chinese cuisine, Desi-Chinese cuisine, Sino-Indian cuisine, Chindian cuisine or Chindi cuisine is a distinct culinary <br>
     style which combines aspects of both Indian and Chinese foods and flavors. Though the cuisines have mixed throughout history both through trade  <br>
     and geographical influence, the most popular origin story of the fusion food resides with the original Chinese ethnic community of Kolkata, who  <br>
     immigrated to India looking for better prospects and a better life around 250 years ago. Opening restaurant businesses in the area, these early <br>
      Chinese immigrants adapted their culinary styles to suit the tastes of their Indian patrons..Chinese Indian food is generally characterized by  <br>
      its ingredients: Indian vegetables and spices are used, along with a heavy amount of pungent Chinese sauces, thickening agents, and oil.  <br>
      Stir-fried in a wok, Indo-Chinese food takes Chinese culinary styles and adds spices and flavors familiar to the Indian tongue. This idea of  <br>
      flavorful, saucy Chinese food cooked with Indian spices and vegetables has become integral to the mainstream culinary scenes of both India and  <br>
      Bangladesh, and its diffusion to nations like America, Great Britain, and Canada has shaped and altered the global view of Chinese, Indian, and  <br>
      Asian cuisines. <br>
      <h4>More about Indo-Chinese food:</h4>
      The most popularized theory for the origins of Indian Chinese food is centered around Chinese immigrants settling in Calcutta (now Kolkata).<br>
       Calcutta was the capital of British-ruled India when it was governed by the East India Trading Company (from 1757 to 1858). The city's <br>
       relation to the British crown made it a great place for material prospects and opportunity, which drew businessmen and immigrant workers from <br>
       surrounding areas. Located in the Northeastern region of India, Calcutta was the most accessible metropolitan area of the country by land <br>
       from China; thus, this city harbored the very first Chinese settler, a southern Chinese man named Tong Atchew (also referred to as Yang Dazhao<br> 
       or Yang Tai Chow). In 1778, Atchew settled 20 miles southwest of Kolkata (then Calcutta), founding a sugar mill along with five dozen or so<br> 
       Chinese laborers. Following Atchew's footsteps, waves of immigrants from the Guangdong province of China fled to India due to civil war,<br> 
       famine, poverty, and conflict, searching for safety and prosperity. Hakka Chinese found their niche as cobblers and tanners, while the Cantonese <br>
       settled majorly as carpenters and the Hubeinese as dentists; however, an occupation popular among all groups, especially of wives supporting their<br>
        laboring husbands, was a restaurateur.<br>
       From these first early settlers, communities of Chinese influence sprung up throughout the area, neighborhoods of immigrants cooking and eating<br>
        foods from their homeland. These Canton cuisines, known in China to be light and fresh in flavor, began to adapt and evolve into the new area.<br>
         One reason is due to the availability of ingredients and spices being different from those in Guangdong, therefore forcing the flavors to naturally<br>
          Indianize; additionally, Chinese businesses began to cater their foods to the tastes of their Indian patrons to increase sales, utilizing more<br> 
          spices and heavier douses of sauce and oil than their traditional techniques required. Recognized as one of the first Indo-Chinese restaurants<br>
           in the country, the still-standing corner eatery of Eau Chew gained its popularity by using the fashionable pull of exotic Chinese foods combined <br>
           with non-threatening familiar flavors of chili, curry, and corn starch, to attract and keep-on customers. Kolkata today boasts the only<br> 
           Chinatown in the country, a neighborhood known as the Tiretti Bazaar. This being said, nearly every city in India has these adapted "Chinese"<br>
            foods, whether found in restaurants or hawked by roadside venders, as the greasy, spicy, stir-fried food has become wildly popular throughout the <br>
            country. It is important also to note those Chinese returning from India to their homelands in China's south, for they often brought their new <br>
            culinary practices and flavors with them, working to Indianize the taste of Cantonese-style foods in southern coastal cities such as Hong Kong.<br>
            As Indian historian Pushpesh Pant once noted, Indian Chinese food is "the result of several isolated encounters." These encounters, in<br> 
            addition to the Kolkata story, include influences of the Silk Road, historical ties, and geography. Each of these aspects has worked in <br>
            some way to tie the culinary practices and flavors of the two countries together, marking other possible origin points for the Indian <br>
            Chinese culinary tradition.
